# Deployment

## Creating a Gitpod Workspace

The project was created in Gitpod using the Code Institute Gitpod Full Template using these steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [Code Institute student template for Gitpod](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
2. Click 'Use this Template' next to the Green Gitpod button.
3. Add a repository name and click 'Create reposiory from template'.
4. This will create a copy of the template in your own repository. Now you can click the green 'Gitpod' button to open a workspace in Gitpod.

## Forking the GitHub Repository

Forks are used to propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. By forking the GitHub Repository you make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository.

To Fork a Github Repository:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/marius-george/blog-project)
2. Locate the Fork button in the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

You will now have a fork of the repository, but you don't have the files in that repository locally on your computer.

To make a local clone:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/marius-george/blog-project)
2. Above the list of files, click  Code.
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", click the 'Copy' icon. To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click Use SSH, then click the 'Copy' icon. To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click Use GitHub CLI, then click the 'Copy' icon.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub AE username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `blogproject`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

Click [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) for the GitHub quick start guide with images and more detailed explanations of the above process.

## Creating an application with Heroku

You will need to deploy the application using Heroku.

1. Create a requirements.txt file by typing ``` pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt ``` into the Gitpod CLI. Ensure this is added to your .gitignore file.
2. Create a Procfile by typing ```echo web: python app.py > Procfile```. Open it and ensure it doesn't have a new line, as this can create errors. Ensure it starts with a capital P.
3. Add and commit these files to Github.
4. Go to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps). Log in or create an account
5. Click the 'New' button and click 'Create new app'.
6. Enter a unique name for your project with no capital letters or spaces and select your region. Click 'Create App'.
7. Inside your project, go to the Resources tab and create a Heroku Postgres Database
8. Inside your project, go to the 'Settings' tab. Scroll down and click 'Reveal Config Vars'.
9. Add in the following variables
  - IP : 0.0.0.0
  - PORT : 5000
  - MONGO_DBNAME : Your MongoDB database name
  - MONGO_URI : This can be found on MongoDB by going to Clusters, Connect, Connect to your application
  - SECRET_KEY : Your secret key
10. Deploy your project by going to the Deploy tab and choose 'Connect to Github'
11. Find your repository name and select Connect.
12. To connect your Heroku database, go to 'More' in the top right and select run console. Enter ```python3``` to access the python intepreter.
13. Then type ```From blogproject import db```. Then type ```db.create_all()```. You can then exit the console.
